      "description": "The Mahabharata tells a story of such violence and tragedy that many people in India refuse to keep the full text in their homes, fearing that if they do, they will invite a disastrous fate upon their house. Covering everything from creation to destruction, this ancient poem remains an indelible part of Hindu culture and a landmark in ancient literature. Centuries of listeners and readers have been drawn to The Mahabharata, which began as disparate oral ballads and grew into a sprawling epic. The modern version is famously long, and at more than 1.8 million words\u2014seven times the combined lengths of the Iliad and Odyssey\u2014it can be incredibly daunting. Contemporary readers have a much more accessible entry point to this important work, thanks to R. K. Narayan\u2019s masterful translation and abridgement of the poem. Now with a new foreword by Wendy Doniger, as well as a concise character and place guide and a family tree, The Mahabharata is ready for a new generation of readers. As Wendy Doniger explains in the foreword, \u201cNarayan tells the stories so well because they\u2019re all his stories.\u201d He grew up hearing them, internalizing their mythology, which gave him an innate ability to choose the right passages and their best translations. In this elegant translation, Narayan ably distills a tale that is both traditional and constantly changing. He draws from both scholarly analysis and creative interpretation and vividly fuses the spiritual with the secular. Through this balance he has produced a translation that is not only clear, but graceful, one that stands as its own story as much as an adaptation of a larger work.",

This is a new and freshly published edition of this culturally important work by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, which is now, at last, again available to you. Enjoy this classic work today. These selected paragraphs distill the contents and give you a quick look inside The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose: Although this plan was adopted, yet before a fourth of the task had been accomplished, an influential Indian journal came down upon poor Pratapa Chandra Roy and accused him openly of being a party to a great literary imposture, viz., of posing before the world as the translator of Vyasas work when, in fact, he was only the publisher. ...Sauti said, Having heard the diverse sacred and wonderful stories which were composed in his Mahabharata by Krishna-Dwaipayana, and which were recited in full by Vaisampayana at the Snake-sacrifice of the high-souled royal sage Janamejaya and in the presence also of that chief of Princes, the son of Parikshit, and having wandered about, visiting many sacred waters and holy shrines, I journeyed to the country venerated by the Dwijas (twice-born) and called Samantapanchaka where formerly was fought the battle between the children of Kuru and Pandu, and all the chiefs of the land ranged on either side. ...Sauti then said, Having bowed down to the primordial being Isana, to whom multitudes make offerings, and who is adored by the multitude; who is the true incorruptible one, Brahma, perceptible, imperceptible, eternal; who is both a non-existing and an existing-non-existing being; who is the universe and also distinct from the existing and non-existing universe; who is the creator of high and low; the ancient, exalted, inexhaustible one; who is Vishnu, beneficent and the beneficence itself, worthy of all preference, pure and immaculate; who is Hari, the ruler of the faculties, the guide of all things moveable and immoveable; I will declare the sacred thoughts of the illustrious sage Vyasa, of marvellous deeds and worshipped here by all. ...The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been explained by me; the various rituals of the Upanishads with the Angas; the compilation of the Puranas and history formed by me and named after the three divisions of time, past, present, and future; the determination of the nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a description of creeds and of the various modes of life; rule for the four castes, and the import of all the Puranas; an account of asceticism and of the duties of a religious student; the dimensions of the sun and moon, the planets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the four ages; the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas; also the Adhyatma; the sciences called Nyaya, Orthphy and Treatment of diseases; charity and Pasupatadharma; birth celestial and human, for particular purposes; also a description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers, mountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas; the art of war; the different kinds of nations and languages: the nature of the manners of the people; and the all-pervading spirit;-all these have been represented.",

      "description": "Excerpt from The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa: Translated Into English Prose Ted Into English Prose Through the grace of Hari who never abandons those that humbly invoke his aid, I have at last completed the Anu\u00e7asana Parvan. Of the eighteen Parvans of the Mahabharata, the Anu\u00e7asana forms the thirteenth, and is the third in extent, being slightly less the Vana. From beginning to end, the Anu\u00e7asana is didactic in tis character. The duties of men in various stations of life have been declared by Bhishma in answer to the successive questions of Yudhishtbira. Of those duties, gift has been declarer to be one of the foremost. Accordingly, the merits, as understood in ancient India, of the diverse kinds of gift have been laid down most appear as quaint to Western readers. But it should always be remembered that those ideas however quaint, are still cherished by ea very large section of the people of India. The very gifts are regarded by them to be meritorious, and are, accordingly, made under nearly the very same formalities. The literary difficulties which the Anu\u00e7asana presents, though slightly less than those presented by the Canti, are still very great. Both the Bengali versions have been executed carelessly. The gloss of Nilakantha, as usual, is clear. There are verses in the Anu\u00e7asana which, if not exactly cruces, are at least very nearly so, considerable labour and reflection being necessary to get at their meaning. The aid offorded by Nilakantha in such places is simply invaluable. The English version of the Anu\u00e7asana has been, for the most part based upon Nilakantha's gloss. It only a few instances has the translator differed from that Commentator. The completion of the Anu\u00e7asana has brought my task to a point such that six or seven more fascicules are necessary for bringing my labours to their termination. Those seven fascicules will cost, including all contingent charges, about Rs. 10,000 in all. How to provide for this amount has made me exceedingly anxious. If I had health and stregth as before, I would not have been at all anxious. Unfortunately for myself, for about two years I have been ill, very ill. For more than six months I have been entirely prostrated. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

The first edition of this work was brought out long, long ago by late Mr. Pratap Chandra Roy, c.i.e. His was the object inspired by noble patriotism, in as much as all the copies of his edition were intended for free distribution. But, unfortu mately, this noble object failed of its purpose and that to the nauseating vileness of many of the recipients of his charity, who took advantage of Pratap Babu's noble simplicity, they having sold out their copies for a money value. It is highly regrettable that many a golden undertaking had this way been smothered out of existence. The result was, the work was priced at Rs. 50/ per copy. People who thirsted after the knowledge of this mighty Mahabharata had no opportunity of going through it at all, for the first edition consisted of a very few copies only. The mantle of Mr. Roy then fell upon late Mr. Manmatha Nath Datta, m.a., who, too, made an earnest attempt at the publication of an English Mahabharata but alas!

The first edition of this work was brought out long, long ago by late Mr. Pratap Chandra Roy, C.I.E. His was the object inspired by noble patriotism, in as much as all the copies of his edition were intended for free distribution. But, unfortunately, this noble object failed of its purpose and that to the nauseating vileness of many of the recipients of his charity, who took advantage of Pratap Babu's noble simplicity, they having sold out their copies for a money value. It is highly regrettable that many a golden undertaking had this way been smothered out of existence. The result was, the work was priced at Rs.50/- per copy. People who thirsted after the knowledge of this mighty Mahabharata had no opportunity of going through it at all, for the first edition consisted of a very few copies only. The mantle of Mr. Roy then fell upon late Mr. Manmatha Nath Datta, M.A., who, too made an earnest attempt at the publication of an English Mahabharata but alas! he was called away before the completion of his huge literary venture. Now-a-days English has become the world language - a language spoken and understood by almost all. The culture of Sanskrit in which the original Mahabharata is clothed is now confined within the coterie of a few Brahmin Pandits in India. Again, the Westerners are quite strangers to Sanskrit language, though they should be enabled to have at least a peep into this vast store of world's knowledge. These are the considerations which have prompted us into bringing out piece-meal this new edition of Mr. Roy's Mahabharata. In order to bring the work within the easy reach of every one, the price of the present edition has been made as low as possible. In view of the prohibitive price of paper it is a venturesome attempt to bring out now a huge work like this. But many a little makes a mickle. It is our confident belief that the unstinted support of the reading public is sure to carry us successfully through this onerous task. Why, is there any other country which can boast of a work such as this our Mahabharata, the stupendous ocean of all-embracing knowledge? Even the most renowned classical works of the West pale into insignificance, when weighed against this wonderful production which shows the high watermark of Indian civilisation. To be patriotic is to be proud of the past glories of one's own country. It is therefore hoped that no Indian with a spark of patriotism in him will tighten his purse-strings against this laudable object of taking to the doors of the West this glorious fruit of the brilliant civilisation of that pre-historic age.

And as they were distracted at heart through fear, these fierce animals discharging urine and dung, set up loud yells with gapping mouths. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it becomes an enriching experience.",

Excerpt: ... at the advent of danger, O monarch, they began to protect! it all the more carefully and adorn it (with defensive worka) The king, however, with his queen, was greatly afflicted, thinking of how a war might not take place with his brother. Reflecting on this, he began to pay his adorations to the gods. His respected wife, beholding him relying on the gods and paying his adorations to them, then addressed him, O king, and said, --Homage to the gods is productive of benefit! It is, therefore, approved by the righteous. What shall I say, again, of those that are sunk in an ocean of distress? Therefore, pay homage to those that are thy superiors, and let all the gods also be worshipped, making large presents the while (unto the Brahmanas)! Let libations be poured on the fire for pacifying the ruler of the Dacarnas. 0 lord, think of the means by which, without a war, thou mayst be able to pacify thy brother! Through the grace of the gods all this will happen. For the preservation of this city, O thou of large eyes, thou hast taken counsel with thy ministers. Do all, O king, that those counsels seem to indicate, for reliance on the gods, when seconded by human exertion, always, 0 king, leadeth to success! If these two do not go hand-in-hand, Buccess becometh unattainable. Therefore, with all thy advisers make such arrangements in thy city as are proper, and pay homage, 0 monarch, as thou pleasest, to the gods!--While husband and wife were conversing with each other thus, both filled with grief, their helpless daughter Cikhandini was filled with shame. She then reflected, saying, --It is for me that these two are plunged into grief!--Thinking so, she resolved Upon putting an end to her own life. Having formed this determination, she left home,",

Mr: H. Witton, who has ever taken a sympa thetic interest in my humble labours, writing to me from Hamilton, Canada, says - I am afraid that it is easier to secure financial assistance in the inceptive stages of an enter. Prise than when it has passed the half-way stage. That is precisely my case. My successive tours through a great part of the country in search of pecuniary aid have broken down my health. The poison of permanent disease has been imbibed. There is a well-known saying current amongst us, that he who succeeds in causing the recitation of the Maha bharata to be completed in his house has to depart from this world. This is explained by some as due to the sins of omission and commission on the part of the reciters or readers -em ployed. Pious men explain it on the supposition that the person is called away, as the result of his high merit, from an unhappy to a happy world. Upon the introduction of printing into this country, the Pundits refused to see the sacred works pass through the Press. The adage referred to above received an expansion. Every man, it came to be said, who would complete the publication or translation of any sacred work, would have to depart from this world in a-childless state; Of[4.

I do not regard even my own self to be mine. On the other hand, I regard the whole world to be mine. I again think that all this (which I see) is as much mine as it belongs to others. Grief cannot approach me in consequence of this thought. Having acquired such an understanding, I do not yield either to joy or to grief. As two pieces of wood floating on the ocean come together at one time and are again separated, even such is the union of (living) creatures in this world. Sons, grandsons, kinsmen, relatives are all of this kind. One should never feel affection for them, for separation with them is certain. Thy son came from an invisible region. He has departed and become invisible. He did not know thee. Thou didst not know him. Who art thou and for whom dost thou grieve? Grieve arises from the disease constituted by desire. Happiness again results from the disease of desire being cured. From joy also springs sorrow, and hence sorrow arises repeatedly. Sorrow comes after joy, and joy after sorrow. The joys and sorrows of human beings are revolving on a wheel. After happiness sorrow has come to thee. Thou shalt again have happiness. No one suffers sorrow for ever, and no one enjoys happiness. for ever. The body is the refuge of both sorrow and happiness. Whatever acts an embodied creature does with the aid of his body, the consequence thereof he has to suffer in that body. Life springs with the springing of the body into existence. The two exist together, and the two perish together. Men of uncleansed souls, wedded to worldly things by various bonds, meet with destruction like embankments of sand in water. Woes of diverse kinds, born of ignorance, act like pressers of oil-seeds, for assailing all creatures in consequence of their attachments. These press them like oil-seeds in the oil-making machine represented by the round of rebirths (to which they are subject).

Through it passeth the river Vaitarani, on the banks whereof even the god of virtue performed religious rites, having first placed himself under the protection of the celestials. Verily this is the northern bank, inhabited by saints, suitable for the performance of reli gious rites beautified by a hill, and frequented by persons of the regena rate caste. This Spot (in holiness) rivals the path wherebyavirtuous man, fit for going to heaven, repairs to the region inhabited by gods. And verily at this Spot in former times, other saints likewise worshipped. The immortals by the performance of religious rites. And at the very Spot it was that the god Rudra, 0 king of kings, seized the sacrificial beast and exclaimed, 'this is my share'! 0 chief of the descendants of Bharata! Then when the beast was carried away by Siva, the gods spake to him saying, 'cast not a covetous glance at the property of others, disregarding all the righteous rules.' Then they addressed words of glori fication ofapleasing kind to the god Rudra. And they satisfied him by offering a sacrifice, and paid him suitable honours. Thereupon he gave up the beast, and went by the path trodden by the gods. Thereupon what happened to Rudra, learn from me, O Yudhishthira! In uenced by the dread of Rudra, the gods set apart for evermore, the best allot ment out of all shares, such as was fresh and not stale to be appropria ted by the god Whosoever performs his ablutions at this spot, while' reciting this ancient' story, beholds with his mortal eyes the path that leads to the region of the gods.

The end that of all perpetrators of wicked acts. And the diverse ends that overtake those who have taken birth among the intermediate orders. Ascertaining the diverse declarations of the Vedas. The courses of seasons. The fading of years. Of months. Of fortnights. And of days. Beholding directly the waxing and the waning of the Moon. Seeing the rising and the ebbing of the seas. And the diminution of wealth and its increase once more. And the separation of united objects. The lapse of Yugas. The destruction of mountains. The drying up of rivers. The deterioration of (the purity of) the several orders and the end also of that deterioration occurring repeatedly beholding the birth. Decrepitude. Death. And sorrows of creatures. Knowing truly the faults attaching to the body and the sorrows to which human beings are subject. And the vicissitudes to which the bodies of creatures are subject. And understanding all the faults that attach to their own souls, and also all the inauspicious faults that attach to their own bodies (the followers of the Sankhya philosophy succeed in attaining to Emancipation).
